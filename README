PHP Documentor for Vim (pdv)

Inspired by phpDoc script for Vim by Vidyut Luther (http://www.phpcult.com/).

Description:
============
This script provides functions to generate docblocks for your PHP code that
conform to the phpDocumentor format. The script currently documents:

- Classes
- Methods/Functions
- Attributes/Properties

All of those supporting all PHP 4 and 5 syntax elements.

Beside that it allows you to define default values for phpDocumentor tags
like @version (I use $Id$ here), @author, @license and so on.

For function/method parameters and attributes, the script tries to guess the
type as good as possible from PHP5 type hints or default values (array, bool,
int, string...).

You can use this script by mapping the function PhpDoc() to any
key combination. Hit this on the line where the element to document
resides and the doc block will be created directly above that line.

Installation:
=============

For example include into your .vimrc:

au BufRead,BufNewFile *.php inoremap <buffer> <C-P> :call PhpDoc()<CR>
au BufRead,BufNewFile *.php nnoremap <buffer> <C-P> :call PhpDoc()<CR>
au BufRead,BufNewFile *.php vnoremap <buffer> <C-P> :call PhpDocRange()<CR>

This will map <ctrl>+p to call the functions to create the docblocks for the
item on the line where the cursor is, or in visual mode, any applicable lines
within that range.

In your .vimrc you can also set the defaults for one or more of the PHP
docblock tags:
let g:pdv_cfg_Package = 'YourPackage'
let g:pdv_cfg_Author = 'Your Name <your.name@exampld.com>'

In you .vimrc, you can also specify the tags and the order they appear for
class docblocks:
let g:pdv_cfg_ClassTags = ["package","author","version"]
